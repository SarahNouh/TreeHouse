### Some Code Conventions:
  1. All imports should be sorted alphabetically
  2. App is split into several folders:
     - **images**:
       - This folder should contain all the assets needed in our application
     - **scripts**:
       - This folder should contain all the js files needed if any.
     - **styles**:
       - This folder should contain all the scss partial files
  3. **Naming Conventions**: 
     - *Files* and *Folders* names should be written in **kebab-case**
  4. All files should have *headers* that contain author and file information
